1. Key take away of gaussian process regression follows the idea of the gaussian process:
  1.1 We may estimate or "define" the covariance with defined kernal functions. This could be useful as data in finance usually has auto correlations and 
further the distance between to point, the smaller the covariance would usually be. 
  1.2 We may be able to choose different kernel functions. 

2. We have GaussianProcessRegressor in scikit-learn
3.
