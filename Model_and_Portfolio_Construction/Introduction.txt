1. This folder includes all the paper, ideas related to models and portfolio constructions. Including but not limited to trading models for high frequency tradings, alpha strategies. 
2. The key of studying different machine learning and statistical models involve two parts:
  2.1 Understand the basic theory of the model.
  2.2 Know how to apply the model in the python.
  2.3 Understand different parameters in the model and how they may affect the result of the model. 
  2.4 Understand the output of the machine learning models and the theory behind them. 
  2.5 Understand the potential way to improve them.

3. There are some universal techniques that may be able to improve the performance of the model i.e. cross-validation method to prevent overfitting. These techniques can be applied to all models so they should be learnt and tried in every models. The method is specifically useful in predicting the result of different models.
