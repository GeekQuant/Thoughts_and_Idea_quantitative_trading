  2.1 Better and more device to generate data. 
  2.2 Data can be recorded automatically instead of manually.

  2.2 Processed data
  2.3 signal
  2.4 strategy

Section 1.4 Many Vs of the big data
1. Volume of the data
  1.1 Refer to the amount of the data generated.
  1.2 It is increasing. 
2. Variety of data
  2.1 Refer to both diversity of the data and format of the data.
  2.2 It is increasing.
3. Velocity of the data
  3.1 Refer to the speed of the data generating.
  3.2 It is increasing.
4. Variability of the data
  4.1 Refer to both the regularity and the inconsistency of the data.
  4.2 It is increasing.
