The Value of alternative data

1. Introduction
	1.1. One key question in the discussion about alternative data is how to assign value to it.

2. The decay of investment value
	2.1. Data, alternative or not, is ultimately used in investing and risk management to make predictions.
	2.2. Semi-EMH states that all the public information will be incorporated in the price of financial assets. If this is true, then a superior return would be available through inside information or  restricted access to a data.
	2.3. Alternative or not, could be of little value unless exploited almost immediately after its release, and gains over the market can only be made by having a speed edge. Here are some counter arguments.
		2.3.1. First, the variety and the multitude of data could make the decay of a signal less rapid.
		2.3.2. Second, if two investors mine the same dataset, the techniques used to transform the raw data into a signal can be quite different.
		2.3.3. Third, another factor that contributes to the persistence of the value of a dataset is the different investment mandates, horizons, styles, and risk appetite that investors have.
		2.3.4. In summary, getting access to the right data at the right time is advantageous for the monetization of a dataset in the likely short opportunity window after it is released. 

3. Data Markets
	3.1. A data marketplace (also called Data as a Service, or DaaS) is essentially a platform in which data sellers and data buyers connect to buy and sell data from each other.
	3.2. From a data user perspective, using a marketplace can help to simplify the process. 
	3.3.
