《Python and Machine-Learning for Asset Management with Alternative Data Sets》. This is a great course in my perspective and provide a very great insight on alternative data set.

Alexander Denev_ Saeed Amen - The Book of Alternative Data_ A Guide for Investors Traders and Risk Managers - Wiley (2020)
