Nowadays, alpha is more and more difficult to generate. I think that the key in generating good alpha involves two key factor. 
1. The ability to use advance technique to capture hidden non linearity between data and potential return. 
  1.1 For example, if we use genetic programming technique to find out the best alpha under selected operations with symbol regression. However the key issue is that the interpretability is undermined due to its non-linearity as well. It means that careful statistical analysis is required. ( Usually there are 1000 -2000 alpha candidates generated during the training, if we select only based on p-value or other statistics result, there might be potential data snooping. 
2. The ability to find longer logic chain that may provide potential insight of the target firm. 
  2.1 For example, simple logic in the form of "fact A -> performance of firm B" is explored quite a lot, and therefore the performance of alpha generated based on these logic might be reduced due to 1. idea is stragitforward so it is easy to be discovered by different firms and 2. The related data might also be overused by different firms. So one step forward, is to use some more further data. One example of the data might be fact A -> potential effect B -> performance of firm C. Compare with using the result of B, fact A usually generates before the event B, so it has some time advantange. 
  2.2 There are two examples of 2.1, which are both too long to be included in this txt file. :)
